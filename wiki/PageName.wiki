#summary Installation on Fedora

= Steps =
  # You need to have sqlite2 library installed. There is no package providing that version of sqlite in Fedora repository, so you have to obtain it elsewhere. Try [ http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/3/srodzaj/1/search/sqlite2 this page ].
  # Download [http://ardb.googlecode.com/files/ardb-2.rc5-svn20081902.fc8.i386.rpm] and install it via yum, rpm or whatever.
  # Run `ardb`, let ARDB download the database (it can take some time) and enjoy
  # If you want ARDB to display card images, then create a `cardimages` directory in your HOME/.ardb directory, and put the image files in it, named like this: _Bum's Rush_ will be _bumsrush.jpg_.
