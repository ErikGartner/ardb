As it's extremely tedious for me to track bugs through multiple emails
and forums, if you want to submit a bug report, please use this link:

https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?func=additem&group=anarchdb

Also, as a general guideline, please include the full text of the
error you get, your email adress so I can contact you for more details
and which steps one should perform to reproduce the
error. 
If the bug is about messed up display or other graphical problem,
please include a http link to a screenshot of the bug.

Thanks.
